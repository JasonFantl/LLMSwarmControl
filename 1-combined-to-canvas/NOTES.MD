## MCP Server

We have a more complex application now, with a canvas where circles and squares can be created, moved, and destroyed.

In spirit this is essentially the same as our counter, where we have a state and a few functions to read and write to that state.

The difference is that we need to provide more instructions to the LLM now for it to operate in our environment. For example, we need to tell it what the ranges of reasonable values are for each arguemnt

We can try more complex tasks and see how the model performs.
